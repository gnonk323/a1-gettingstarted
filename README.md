This project shows my name, graduation year from WPI, my major and minor, the computer science courses I've taken at WPI, and my experience in various areas relating to web development. It also contains a form about my hobby of skiing, as well as links to the WPI website and Newschoolers, an online skiing community.

## Design Achievements
